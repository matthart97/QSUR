# Quantitative Structure Use-Case Relationships (QSUR)

Here we explore the use of machine learning to predict use cases of molecules. 

The original datasets used in this study are the Chemical Products Database, [CPDat](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018125) and the Patent-extracted Chemical-structure Images database for Discovery, [PatCID](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50779-y)

The code in this repository represents both modeling prototypes and case studies with the most successful model. 

This is a work in progress!
